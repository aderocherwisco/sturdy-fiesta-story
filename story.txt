It was the day of the first Computer Science midterm, and I was very nervous.
It isn't like I've never taken a Computer Science exam before, but this is CS400.
This exam will certainly be the most difficult one I've ever taken, and despite
all my studying, I remain apprehensive. So many different things could go wrong.
What if I misunderstood how AVL works? What if they ask me to implement a Red Black
Tree delete method? What if I couldn't even find the test room in time? I
decided to leave for the testing site a whole 45 minutes early. Surely this would
ensure I couldn't possibly miss it.

I walked out of Chamberlin Hall towards the testing site that was about ten
minutes away. I was walking swiftly in hopes of getting there quicker than
everyone else. Then, I realized that my shoe became untied. I crouched
down and tied it up. I then heard a strange noise and looked up to see
what it was.
