It was the day of the first Computer Science midterm, and I was very nervous.
It isn't like I've never taken a Computer Science exam before, but this is CS400.
This exam will certainly be the most difficult one I've ever taken, and despite
all my studying, I remain apprehensive. So many different things could go wrong.
What if I misunderstood how AVL works? What if they ask me to implement a Red Black
Tree delete method? What if I couldn't even find the test room in time? I
decided to leave for the testing site a whole 45 minutes early. Surely this would
ensure I couldn't possibly miss it.

I walked out of Chamberlin Hall towards the testing site that was about ten
minutes away. I was walking swiftly in hopes of getting there quicker than
everyone else. Then, I realized that my shoe became untied. I crouched
down and tied it up. I then heard a strange noise and looked up to see
what it was.

A large man was screaming at a group of students in front of one of the halls.
"Oh crap, I don't have time for this" I thought to myself. A crowd of people had formed,
blocking my path. I got up from tying my shoe, put my head down and started walking towards
the crowd.

The man started pushing through the crowd, and I looked back in horror to realize that he was following me.
I kept walking away, trying to get away from this mysterious figure, but he was persistent, and 
started shouting "Hey, you" towards me.

Suddenly I recognize the shiny, bald head. Professor Doe. My sworn nemesis. Not only had he 
failed me in CS 300, but he seems to continually sabotage my academic pursuits despite 
seeming to gain little from it himself. Luckily, I narrowly esccaped, and aced my midterm.
Huzzah!
